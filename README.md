The visual clock is an interactive, real-time analog clock built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It dynamically updates every second, showing the current time with hour, minute, and second hands in a smooth and visually appealing way.

This project is perfect for practicing **DOM manipulation, CSS animations, and JavaScript Date methods**, and serves as a simple but effective portfolio project for web development enthusiasts.
